  "2": "The progressive historical role of capitalism may be summed\nup in two brief propositions: increase in the productive forces of\nsocial labour, and the socialisation of that labour.

  "3": " ",
  "4": "Perhaps the profoundest cause of disagreement with the\nNarodniks is the difference in our fundamental views on social and\neconomic processes. When studying the latter, the Narodnik usually\ndraws conclusions that point to some moral; he does not regard the\ndiverse groups of persons taking part in production as creators of\nvarious forms of life; he does not set out to present the sum-total of\nsocial and economic relationships as the result of the mutual relations\nbetween these groups, which have different interests and different\nhistorical roles. ... \n\nLenin, The\nDevelopment of Capitalism in Russia, The “The\nMission of Capitalism” (1899)",

  "14": "We are marching in a compact group along a precipitous and\ndifficult path, firmly holding each other by the hand. We are\nsurrounded on all sides by enemies, and we have to advance almost\nconstantly under their fire. We have combined, by a freely adopted\ndecision, for the purpose of fighting the enemy, and not of retreating\ninto the neighbouring marsh, the inhabitants of which, from the very\noutset, have reproached us with having separated ourselves into an\nexclusive group and with having chosen the path of struggle instead of\nthe path of conciliation. And now some among us begin to cry out: Let\nus go into the marsh! And when we begin to shame them, they retort:\nWhat backward people you are! Are you not ashamed to deny us the\nliberty to invite you to take a better road! Oh, yes, gentlemen! You\nare free not only to invite us, but to go yourselves wherever you will,\neven into the marsh. In fact, we think that the marsh is your proper\nplace, and we are prepared to render you every assistance to get there.\nOnly let go of our hands, don’t clutch at us and\ndon’t besmirch the grand word freedom, for we too are\n“free” to go where we please, free to fight not\nonly against the marsh, but also against those who are turning towards\nthe marsh! \n\nLenin, What Is To Be\nDone?, “Dogmatism And ‘Freedom of\nCriticism’” (1901)",

  "16": "In a country ruled by an autocracy, with a completely\nenslaved press, in a period of desperate political reaction in which\neven the tiniest outgrowth of political discontent and protest is\npersecuted, the theory of revolutionary Marxism suddenly forced its way\ninto the censored literature before the government\nrealised what had happened and the unwieldy army of censors and\ngendarmes discovered the new enemy and flung itself upon him. \n\nLenin, What Is To Be\nDone?, “Criticism in Russia” (1901)",

  "18": "This fear of criticism displayed by the advocates of freedom\nof criticism cannot be attributed solely to craftiness.

  "20": "History has now confronted us with an immediate task which\nis the most revolutionary of all the immediate tasks confronting the\nproletariat of any country. The fulfilment of this task, the\ndestruction of the most powerful bulwark, not only of European, but (it\nmay now be said) of Asiatic reaction, would make the Russian\nproletariat the vanguard of the international revolutionary\nproletariat. And we have the right to count upon acquiring this\nhonourable title, already earned by our predecessors, the\nrevolutionaries of the seventies, if we succeed in inspiring our\nmovement, which is a thousand times broader and deeper, with the same\ndevoted determination and vigour.\n\nLenin, What Is To Be\nDone?, “Criticism in Russia” (1901)",

There is no middle course (for mankind has not created a\n“third” ideology).\n\n(This does not mean, of course, that the workers have no part in\ncreating such an ideology. They take part, however, not as workers, but\nas socialist theoreticians, as Proudhons and Weitlings, to the extent\nthat they are able to acquire the knowledge of their age and develop\nthat knowledge.)\n\nLenin, What Is To Be\nDone?, “The Spontaneity of the Masses and the\nConsciousness of the Social-Democrats” (1901)",
  "23": " ",
  "24": "To belittle the socialist ideology in any way, to\nturn aside from it in the slightest degree means to\nstrengthen bourgeois ideology. There is much talk of spontaneity. But\nthe spontaneous development of the working-class\nmovement leads to its subordination to bourgeois ideology; for the\nspontaneous working-class movement is trade-unionism, and trade\nunionism means the ideological enslavement of the workers by the\nbourgeoisie. Hence, our task, the task of Social-Democracy, is to\ncombat spontaneity, to divert the working-class movement from\nthis spontaneous, trade-unionist striving to come under the wing of the\nbourgeoisie, and to bring it under the wing of revolutionary Social\nDemocracy.\n\nLenin, What Is To Be\nDone?, “The Spontaneity of the Masses and the\nConsciousness of the Social-Democrats” (1901)",

The only difference is between what is known and what is\nnot yet known. And philosophical inventions of specific boundaries\nbetween the one and the other, inventions to the effect that the\nthing-in-itself is “beyond” phenomena (Kant), or\nthat we can and must fence ourselves off by some philosophical\npartition from the problem of a world which in one part or another is\nstill unknown but which exists outside us (Hume)—all this is\nthe sheerest nonsense, Schrulle, crotchet,\ninvention.\n3) In the theory of knowledge, as in every other branch of science, we\nmust think dialectically, that is, we must not regard our knowledge as\nready-made and unalterable, but must determine how knowledge\nemerges from ignorance, how incomplete, inexact\nknowledge becomes more complete and more exact.\n\nLenin, Materialism and\nEmpirio-Criticism (1908)",
